# .Net-WindowsApp-Payment_Manager

It is an another major application that I have created in .Net(C#). 

It a Windows app which will act as a Payment Gateway. A payment gateway is a secure e-commerce service that authorizes online payments for customers and connects with all financial institutions involved during the transaction.

The application will:
 Validate and process credit card payments
 Save the payment transactions into a database
 Offer the option to backup the database contents as a .CSV file

Inorder to Run or test the application download the files and go to:bin/Debug/Assignment4-Beanstream.exe
